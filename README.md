Chose options as per your required task.
The app stores and updates data in a SQL database and the one listed in the files is a test db that I created. Kindly update the details if you wish to use it in your app
I have also supplied the logo file in a PNG format. make sure to change the directory when you are using this code to correctly call the logo file.
The invoice generated along with the final bill is stored in the Results Folder.
Kindly note that you will need to backup the pdf files in case you want to use them later. The program is capable of replacing the original files having the same names when it is run
The bill numbers are automatically system generated

The next update will feature a modify bill option alongwith updated file handling protocols. Stay Tuned!
